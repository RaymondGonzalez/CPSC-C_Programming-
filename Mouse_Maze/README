Used C to create a randomly generating maze that a mouse must navigate through to get to the cheese.
The density and speed of mouse is set by the user. The mouse starts on one side while the cheese is on the other side.
The mouse navigates the maze while the amount of steps it took is tracked. If the mouse succeeds in getting the cheese 
the program will display "SUCCEED" and display the amount of steps took. If mouse takes over 5000 steps the program 
displays "FAILED".
